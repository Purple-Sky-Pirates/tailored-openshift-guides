In EKS, you can route traffic to your application by creating a _Service_ or an _Ingress_. This creates an _AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)_. 

To migrate to OpenShift, it's generally preferred to change to `Route` resources, which offer a little more control.

== Prefer Routes for inbound traffic

In OpenShift, the resource which exposes a `Service` outside the cluster is called a `Route`. 

A Route exposes your Kubernetes _Service_ to the outside world via a proxy server which is present in the cluster. A Route also adds TLS encryption (HTTPS) automatically.

The _Route_ object looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: my-app
    weight: 100
```

You don't need to specify a hostname when the Route is created. OpenShift will automatically assign a URL based on the cluster suffix (e.g. `*.apps.example.org`), the Project, and the name of the Route.

NOTE: It's technically possible in some OpenShift environments to expose your application by creating a _Service_ of type `LoadBalancer`, but creating a _Route_ is the recommended option as it offers way more control.
