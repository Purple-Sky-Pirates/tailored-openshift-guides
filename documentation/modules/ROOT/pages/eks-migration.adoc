= Migrating from vanilla Kubernetes or EKS

If you've already got an application running on **Amazon's Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** that you want to migrate to OpenShift, great! You're already most of the way to cloud-native.

**OpenShift is a _distribution_ of Kubernetes.** It includes Kubernetes, and extends it. OpenShift supports most standard Kubernetes APIs, and the `oc` command-line tool is almost identical to the familiar `kubectl` from Kubernetes.

Perhaps the most immediate notable difference is that OpenShift also provides a web console which you can use for deploying and inspecting apps on the platform.

But, there are a few more differences that you need to consider. Here's a typical Kubernetes application:

While OpenShift will happily run most applications which have been designed for Kubernetes, there are still some differences to be aware of.

So if you're bringing your own application from EKS to OpenShift, here are some of the main areas that you should think about:
