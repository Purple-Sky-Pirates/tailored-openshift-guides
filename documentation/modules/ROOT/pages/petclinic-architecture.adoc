:navtitle: Petclinic Architecture

This lab introduces you to the architecture of the Petclinic application used throughout this workshop, to get a better understanding of the things you'll be doing from a developer perspective. Petclinic is a simple spring boot application, which can be configured to connect to an external data source.  In this example we will attach to a MySQL database.
