= Petclinic Backend
:navtitle: Petclinic Backend

Petclinic is a simple spring boot application, ad in this section we will configure our project to include a MySQL database and configure the application to connect to it.

[#deploy_database_from_template]
== Exercise: Deploying from an Openshift Template

A *template* describes a set of objects that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects for creation by OpenShift Container Platform.

More information about *templates* can be found here: 
{openshift-docs-url}/openshift_images/using-templates.html[Using Openshift Templates].

You can instantiate a Template either from the OpenShift Console or using the `oc` CLI.  Use the tabs to choose your desired approach for instantiating a template.


[tabs]
====
OpenShift Console::
+
--
We will select a database from the available *Templates* on the platform.  Firstly navigate to the Developer View, and click +Add.

From here we select *Database*.

image::petclinic-developer-add-database.png[Add Database]

Now in the Developer Catalog we should select *MySQL (Ephemeral)*.

image::petclinic-developer-select-database.png[Add Database]

We will be presented with a description of the template along with links to documentation from the template provider.  Here we need to click to instantiate the template.

image::petclinic-database-instantiate-template.png[Instantiate Template]

We will be presented with parameters to fill in, so that the template can generate the required objects in Openshift.  Here you can use the following

.MySQL Connection Username
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
sqluser
----

.MySQL Connection Password
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
Passw0rd!
----

.MySQL root user Password
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
rootPassw0rd!
----

WARNING: Remember that when this pod is deleted that any data in it will be erased.  It is otherwise possible to use a database with persistence, where the data will be held, and therefore remain on pod deletions/restarts.



--
`oc` Command Line::
+
--
We can look for the templates which exist in the openshift namespace.
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get templates -n openshift | grep mysql-e
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]

----

The mysql-ephemeral is the one we need.  Now we need to instantiate the *Template*, we should first inspect the parameters that we may need to supply :

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get templates/mysql-ephemeral -n openshift -o yaml
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: template.openshift.io/v1
kind: Template
labels:
  template: mysql-ephemeral-template
.....[All the objects that would be created are listed]
parameters:
- description: Password for the MySQL connection user.
  displayName: MySQL Connection Password
  from: '[a-zA-Z0-9]{16}'
  generate: expression
  name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
  required: true
- description: Password for the MySQL root user.
  displayName: MySQL root user Password
  from: '[a-zA-Z0-9]{16}'
  generate: expression
  name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
  required: true
- description: Name of the MySQL database accessed.
  displayName: MySQL Database Name
  name: MYSQL_DATABASE
  required: true
  value: sampledb
----

Note the parameters and the ones we may need to change.  We will supply some on the command line as follows:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc new-app --template=mysql-ephemeral -p MYSQL_USER=mysqluser -p MYSQL_PASSWORD=Passw0rd! -p MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootPassw0rd!

     MySQL (Ephemeral)

After a while we should see that we have a MySQL *DeploymentConfig* available in our project:

image::petclinic-database-dc-topology.png[MySQL Database Deployment]

[#linking_frontend_to_backend]
== Exercise: Linking the Frontend to the Backend

At this point we have the `petclinic` frontend available, but it is currently not using the database.  We need to configure the application to use the database.

The template also created a service in the project, we can see this via the resources view:

image::petclinic-database-service.png[MySQL Database Service]

The `petclinic` app uses the following java properties - this is taken from https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/spring-petclinic/blob/main/src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties:

[source,bash]
----
database=mysql
spring.datasource.url=${MYSQL_URL:jdbc:mysql://localhost/petclinic}
spring.datasource.username=${MYSQL_USER:petclinic}
spring.datasource.password=${MYSQL_PASS:petclinic}
# SQL is written to be idempotent so this is safe
spring.datasource.initialization-mode=always
----

It can be seen from here that we need to modify the properties as per our MySQL deployment.  We need to navigate to the petclinic deployment and find the `Edit Deployment` option in the `Actions` dropdown.

image::petclinic-topology-edit-deployment.png[Edit Deployment]

We will then be presented with the deployment configuration:

image::petclinic-edit-deployment-1.png[Edit Deployment 1]

image::petclinic-edit-deployment-2.png[Edit Deployment 2]

Here we must add environment variables as follows:

[source,bash]
----
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=mysql
MYSQL_URL=jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/sampledb
MYSQL_USER=sqluser
MYSQL_PASS=Passw0rd!
----

Hopefully your environmrnt variables section will look like this, you'll have to `+Add Value` a few times to add extra environment variables.

image::petclinic-edit-deployment-envvars.png[Deployment EnvVars]

Once saved by clicking the blue `Save` button.  This will result in the petclinic pod being deleted and a new version of the pod with updated configuration being rolled out by the replicaset.

Let us confirm via the command-line that the environment variables have been applied to the pod.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc get pods -l app=petclinic -o yaml
----

It should be seen that the pod spec has been updated appropriately:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
....
  spec:
    containers:
    - env:
      - name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
        value: mysql
      - name: MYSQL_URL
        value: jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/sampledb
      - name: MYSQL_USER
        value: sqluser
      - name: MYSQL_PASS
        value: Passw0rd!

      name: petclinic
....

Congratulations!  We should now have a front-end petclinic pod talking to a backend mysql pod!

[#verify_application]
== Exercise: Verify Application

How can we now verify that the application is connected to the back end?  We can check the database to see if it is being populated.  

Let's navigate to the Pod and open up a Terminal...

image::petclinic-database-pod-terminal.png[Database Pod Terminal]

We can log into the database and run some sql commands...

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mysql -u sqluser -h mysql -p
use sampledb;
show tables;
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----

| pets               |

| vet_specialties    |

+--------------------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)

Great!  So now, let us use the front end of the application to manipulate and/or add some data.  

On the main petclinic url, let's use the `FIND OWNERS` tab and click `Add Owner` from there.

image::petclinic-add-owner-start.png[Add Owner Start]

Let's add some sample user data:

image::petclinic-add-owner.png[Add Owner]

Here we can confirm that the user is listed on the front end.

image::petclinic-list-owner.png[List Owner]

Let's go back to our mysql pod terminal and query the database for our new user:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
SELECT * from owners where first_name = 'Some';
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
+----+------------+-----------+--------------+-----------+-----------+
| id | first_name | last_name | address      | city      | telephone |
+----+------------+-----------+--------------+-----------+-----------+
| 12 | Some       | User      | Some Address | Some City | 123456789 |
+----+------------+-----------+--------------+-----------+-----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
----

Excellent.  All verified.  Our front end is now talking to the MySQL backend!
