= Container images

When running a different distribution of Kubernetes, you might be able to use any images you like.

However OpenShift comes with some supported images which you can use in your applications. This page gives some considerations for which images to use when running on OpenShift.

== Prefer supported base images

OpenShift comes with a bunch of base images which you can use to build container images for your applications. The images are supported by Red Hat and patched regularly.

The images start with a supported operating system (RHEL), and add certified libraries and runtime environments, ready for you to add your code on top.

This means that you shouldn't need to build your own base images (from scratch) for your applications.

.Using a supported base image

The general approach with the supported images is to use them as a _"base"_ or _"parent" image_ for your application, as part of:

- A Docker build, or

- A Source-to-Image (S2I) build

=== Finding images

Images are available for most mainstream languages, including:

- Ruby

- Java

- Python

- Node.js

Images are usually made available as _Image Streams_. An Image Stream is an OpenShift object that points to a container image. Image Streams are used mainly to share images across the cluster, and can be used as triggers for builds and deployments.

.Using an ImageStream from the "openshift" Project
image::eks-building-image.png[Using an ImageStream from the "openshift" Project,align="center"]

To search for image streams already installed into the cluster, you can use `oc new-app --search`:

----
$ oc new-app --search java 
-----
java
  Project: openshift
  Tags:    latest, openjdk-11-el7, openjdk-11-ubi8, openjdk-8-el7, openjdk-8-ubi8
----

This tells us that there is a `java` image stream in the `openshift` namespace, with tags `latest`, `openjdk-11-el7`, etc.

To find all of the base images available and find out more, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_software_collections/3/html/using_red_hat_software_collections_container_images[Using Red Hat Software Collections Container Images].

=== Example

For example, to use the supported OpenJDK base image for a Java application, create an _ImageStream_ for your application:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  name: java-sample
  labels:
    application: java-sample
----

Then create a _BuildConfig_ similar to this. This references the `java` image stream in the `openshift` namespace:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: java-sample
  labels:
    application: java-sample
spec:
  source:
    type: Git
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/jboss-openshift/openshift-quickstarts
    contextDir: undertow-servlet
  strategy:
    type: Source
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        namespace: openshift
        name: java:openjdk-11-el7
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: java-sample:latest
----

NOTE: If the `java` image isn't installed, you can install it manually

== Prefer supported Linux

If you need to develop directly against Linux, you can also use a supported Linux image which is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

The supported image is called the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI), and you can find out more about it here:

- https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi

- https://access.redhat.com/articles/4238681

Like the application/S2I images, this UBI image is patched regularly.

== Prefer supported third-party applications

OpenShift also comes with supported images for some third-party applications, like databases.

For example:

- MySQL

- PostgreSQL

- Redis

You can find templates to deploy these applications in the OpenShift web console.
