== Introduction to ArgoCD

GitOps is a declarative way to implement continuous deployment for cloud native applications. You can use GitOps to create repeatable processes for managing OpenShift Container Platform clusters and applications across multi-cluster Kubernetes environments. GitOps handles and automates complex deployments at a fast pace, saving time during deployment and release cycles.


== Installation

As a Cluster admin, the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps operator can be installed via the OperatorHub.

NOTE: Had to increase CRC CPUs to 8 for all the pods to come up and running with `crc config set cpus 8`

The operator creates a new project called `openshift-gitops`:


[source%nowrap,console]
----
oc project openshift-gitops
----

[source%nowrap,console]
----
oc get pods
----

Obtain the `openshift-gitops-server` route to ArgoCD:


[source%nowrap,console]
----
oc get routes
----

== Logging in

In the Administrator perspective of the web console, navigate to Operators → Installed Operators to verify that the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Operator is installed.

Navigate to the red hat applications menu icon menu → Application Stages → Argo CD. The login page of the Argo CD UI is displayed in a new window.

You can select "LOG IN VIA OPENSHIFT" to log in with regular accounts:

Or obtain the `admin` user password and log in with the administrator account. Obtain the password for the Argo CD instance by navigating to the Developer perspective of the web console, navigate to the `openshift-gitops` project and use the left navigation panel to navigate to the Secrets page.

Select the openshift-gitops-cluster instance to display and copy the password
