== Introduction to FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. Similar to Flask yet built with async and await support from the ground up.

This section walks through writing a starter API, containerizing it with Podman, and then onto using Helm and ArgoCD, and finally KNative.
